# PinPoint

I made this project to learn more about Leaflet and Laravel and React with Inertia.


## **What's the purpose?**
- Users can register new accounts.
- Publish posts.
- See the posts in the radius of their location. (4000m)
- All the posts have pinpoints on the map to see from where they were posted.
